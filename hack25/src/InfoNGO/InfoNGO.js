            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>
              Since our founding, OMS Learn Together has transformed education in 45 rural communities across Mexico. We've installed solar panels in schools, providing reliable electricity for the first time to thousands of students. Our interactive workshops teach children about wind energy, solar power, and sustainable living practices they can implement in their own homes and communities. Students learn to build simple solar devices, understand energy efficiency, and become ambassadors for environmental change in their villages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The impact extends beyond the classroom. Families of our students have adopted renewable energy solutions, reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and lowering household expenses. Communities have seen improved air quality, increased local employment through green energy projects, and a renewed sense of hope for their environmental future. Our alumni are now pursuing careers in renewable energy, environmental science, and sustainable developmentâ€”proof that education and opportunity can break cycles of poverty while protecting our planet.
